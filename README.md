Senior Frontend Developer with 5+ years of commercial experience building new projects from scratch and developing existing ones. Developed 3 major successful products in the Education, Social Media & Gambling/Betting domains

I am a specialist who can be given a challenge and be sure that I will bring it to completion. Iâ€™ll initiate all the necessary communications, clarify the business requirements, note the controversial points, make suggestions, discuss with other team members if necessary, and solve the problem within the estimated time frame

I have extensive experience in meeting business needs using TypeScript/JavaScript, React.js (and the ecosystem around it), HTML/CSS (preprocessors, CSS-in-JS), Jest/React Testing Library (unit/integration tests)

Looking for an exciting product and eager to solve non-standard complex engineering tasks
